Next updates: MOAR FIGHTS

Update (12/9/17) - Power System complete w/ basic Transformations tied into damage mechanics. Probably needs more balancing. Added EXP bar to end of fights after a LOT of tears. Not happy with it but it'll do for now. Extra fights delayed for the moment. New release up!

Update (11/9/17) - Added Power Bar and basis of the Power system. Hopefully will be finished tomorrow with Transformations too! Fingers crossed for another release.

Update (10/9/17) - Added the Credits screen, available from the options menu. Added the stats screen, available from the title menu. Experience system added with Stat Points. 0.1.2 build up.

Update (8/9/17) - Now back from holidays! Currently focusing on finding a new job, but I'll try to keep updating here. Also planning to start noting down the next project goals here in the README for your (and my) convenience.
