Release Update! (14/11/17)
I completely forgot to update this! Project Potential is now essentially complete and available for free on the Google Play Store!

No further updates to this repo are planned, and finalised files will not be uploaded, though not much is different between the final build and the one available here.

Update (14/10/17) - Sorry for the delay! Been concentrating on the job hunt and looking after myself. Level Select and fights are in! Boss has some unique animation. Probably has massive balance issues for now. Release soon-ish, not far off gold release now. 

Update (12/9/17) - Power System complete w/ basic Transformations tied into damage mechanics. Probably needs more balancing. Added EXP bar to end of fights after a LOT of tears. Not happy with it but it'll do for now. Extra fights delayed for the moment. New release up!

Update (11/9/17) - Added Power Bar and basis of the Power system. Hopefully will be finished tomorrow with Transformations too! Fingers crossed for another release.

Update (10/9/17) - Added the Credits screen, available from the options menu. Added the stats screen, available from the title menu. Experience system added with Stat Points. 0.1.2 build up.

Update (8/9/17) - Now back from holidays! Currently focusing on finding a new job, but I'll try to keep updating here. Also planning to start noting down the next project goals here in the README for your (and my) convenience.
